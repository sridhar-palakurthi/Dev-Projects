This project demonstrates about how to use Apache camel framework.
I took advantage of combining Cxf rest services for the project.
Once you  deploy, you can Test the webservices in the REST client.
Only Backend server code is provided, no front End UI.

This will take the User object
id,name,ssn as a json object and stores the same in mysql (DEMO_TEST) Database at your 3306 port.
And you can find All the CRUD operations available in the provided source code.

Happy coding.. :)
